# Integration-project

This AWS Serverless project uses Terraform to manage infrastructure as code (IaC) and Python for Lambda functions. It provisions AWS resources such as Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB, and automates the deployment process with a GitHub Actions pipeline for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). This setup ensures automated, scalable, and cost-efficient handling of serverless workloads.
